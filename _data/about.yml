 I am an engineer interested in machine learning and I use software as a lens to view biology.
 From 2011-2014 I studied biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California. 
 At USC I was enthralled by the neuroscience topics.
 In 2015 I went to work at Cedars Sinai Medical Center to develop in the new field of digital pathology.
 I work with machine learning to identify and predict the behavior of tumors using routinely stained tissues.
 While working on various projects, I've been able to study many topics in deep learning and statistical machine learning.
 Currently I'm looking for opportunities to study and apply causal reasoning to answer mechanistic questions from data.
