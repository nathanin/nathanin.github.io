 I am an engineer interested in machine learning and I use software as a lens to view biology.
 From 2011-2014 I studied biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California. 
 In 2015 I went to work at Cedars Sinai Medical Center to develop in the new field of digital pathology.
 I learn best from projects, and I've fortunately been required to learn about deep learning, statistical machine learning, and most recently graph analysis.
 Currently I'm looking for opportunities to study and apply these tools to answer questions about tumor evolution and treatment response.
